SeleniumSpecs
=============
----
## Selenium with Specs2 on Scala

This enables you to test on Selenium web driver with Scala Specs2.

## Motivation

- Selenium with Scala

I want to write Scala for Selenium.


### for comparison
- ScalaTest

ScalaTest has the integration with Selenium.
It looks good firstly but it's so inflexible and annoys me.
e.g. you can't set webdriver path in your code.

- FluentLenium

FluentLenium provides DSL for Selenium.
But it's written by Java.
